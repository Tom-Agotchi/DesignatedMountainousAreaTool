3D Airport Terrain & Obstacle Databases (eTOD)

By 2015, all ICAO Civil Aviations Authorities must capture this data for:

Ground proximity warning system (MSAW) minimum safe altitude warning
determination of contingency procedures for use in the event of an emergency during a missed approach or take-off
Navaid-based Procedure Design
PBN Procedure Design
Engine-Out Procedure Design
Noise-Abatement Procedure Design
Drift-down/Let-down Procedure Design
Pressurization-Failure Escape Routes
Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Airports, synthetic vision system
Less CFIT and RS Accidents, more precise DTM vizualisation and elevation
Better Airport GIS management (Edmonton Int)
Transition AIS to AIM (Paper to Digital) chart production and on-board database
Part of NextGen and SESAR
Impacting the en-route phase of flight
At the aerodrome impacting the circling area (ASMGCS) advanced surface movement guidance and control system
At the aerodrome impacting the approuch / take-off phases of flight
Analysis for Obstacle (height restriction) remove tower
